Haiku is a hyperminimalistic theme for WordPress blogs. Originally created for [ErikBoesen](https://github.com/ErikBoesen)'s [Daily Haiku Blog](http://erikboesen.com/haiku), it is now available for public usage. Unlike the original, this version of the theme is compatible with larger posts and shows post titles.
