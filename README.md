Haiku is a hyper-hyper-hyper-minimalistic theme for WordPress blogs. Originally created for [ErikBoesen](https://github.com/ErikBoesen)'s [Daily Haiku Blog](http://erikboesen.com/haiku), it is now available for public usage. However, it is not recommended unless you are completely out of your mind.
